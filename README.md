## Impressions

I'm impressed by the versatility of PHP, especially its efficiency in creating complex structures with minimal code. Comparatively, JavaScript took more effort for a similar task.

I hope that my logic, coding style, and other qualities are apparent in the code. I look forward to feedback from experienced developers for potential collaboration and future prospects.
